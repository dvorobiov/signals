# REST backend with Scala, Spray, Akka and ReactiveMongo

This is the project to learn, estimate building REST backends with Scala, Spray, Akka and ReactiveMongo.
I would like to create reusable patterns, estimate benefits and drawbacks of this stack.

The project is a set of endpoints to cover some of my needs:
+ web links management
+ notes taking
+ to-do lists
+ the ambitious goal is to create a light version of org-mode, though Clojure would be more relative here

Or maybe I'll use this project to create web analysics tool :)
